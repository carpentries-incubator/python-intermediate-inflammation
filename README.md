# Introduction

This is a template software project repository used by the [Intermediate Research Software Development Skills In Python](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-development).

## Purpose

This repository is intended to be used as a code template which is copied by learners at [Intermediate Research Software Development Skills In Python](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-development) course.

This software project is not finished, does not contain a LICENCE file, the code is currently failing to run and contains some code style issues. 
It is used as a starting point for the course - issues will be fixed and code will be added in a number of places during the course by learners in their own copies of the repository, as course topics are introduced.

## Tests

Several tests have been implemented already, some of which are currently failing.
These failing tests set out the requirements for the additional code to be implemented during the workshop.

The tests should be run using `pytest`, which will be introduced during the workshop.
